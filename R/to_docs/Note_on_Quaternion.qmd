# A short note on rotations

In the figure, you can see a sketch of the situation for gesture recognition. We are interested in "the relative positions" between the palm and thumb on the one side and the laboratory system. As we will see this can be described in the framework of rotations.

### A first rotation

Before we go into some math, lets have a first look how a rotation might look like. On the left side you see data points in the original space. On the right side a rotation by 45 degrees around the z-axis that have been applied to the points. This rotation can be obtained by a rotation matrix R:

```{r, warning=FALSE, name='bunny', fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, fig.cap='Left: orinial data. Right: data rotated by 45 degrees around y-axis (or coordinate system rotated by -45) degrees. The y-axis points up and the rotation is done in counter clock-wise manner'}
#dim(rabbit) #5000     3 A subsampled version of the standford buny with head up z-Axis
R = matrix(c(0.7071068,  0.7071068,  0.0000000, -0.7071068,  0.7071068,  0.0000000,  0.0000000,  0.0000000,  1.0000000), nrow=3)
round(R,4)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
p3d(rabbit, h=NULL, xlab='x', ylab='y', zlab='z', )
#It's vector times Matrix for row-vectors
#Therefore we have to transpose (R x) to x^T R^T
p3d(rabbit %*% t(R), h=NULL) 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## Definition of rotations

Rotations between rigid objects can be described as a linear transformation from one coordinate system to another, with the same origin. A first example is the bunny from above. A practical example of such a rotation is the orientation of your cell phone after you picked it up compared to the position on the table, or the orientation of the thumb in figure. Another good example is a plane which is at $t=0$ on the ground and at $t=t$ in the air. Besides the translation, the orientation of the plane at $t=0$ relative to the plane at $t=t$ can be described by a different heading (the *yaw* angle) obtained while taxing, the *pitch* angle obtained in the climbing phase and a rotation around the axis of flight the *roll* angle. During this phase many rotations can happen but they can all be summarized in a single rotation.

More formally the rotations between the two planes can be described by a rotation matrix $R$ , which transforms the coordinate system of the plane at $t=0$ to the coordinate system of the plane at $t=t$. This matrix is defined by the transformation of unit vectors $\vec{e_x},\vec{e_y},\vec{e_z}$ of coordinate system (say that at $t=0$) to a coordinate system $\vec{e'_x},\vec{e'_y},\vec{e'_z}$ at $t=t$. As my famous professor in linear algebra always repeated the columns of a (transformation) matrix are the images of the unit vectors[^1]. So the first column of $R$ is given by $R \cdot \vec{e_x}$ second by $R \cdot \vec{e_y}$, and the third by $R \cdot \vec{e_z}$.

[^1]: He was German and said: "Die Spalten einer Matrix sind die Bilder der Einheitsvektoren".

## Parameterization

### Definition of rotations

Rotations can be seen as linear transformation from one coordinate system into another. There are several way to parametrize them. The first is via a rotation matrix.

### Rotation matrix

In principal a rotation is given by the 9 matrix elements of $R$. However they cannot be arbitrary, they still need to describe rotations. What are the defining properties of rotations? It turns out that a rotation, has an inverse and the inverse simply the transposed $R^{-1} = R^T$ (this is the orthogonality). Further, $det(R)=1$ this is a consequence that the volume in the rotated system stays constant and also the orientation (it's $det(R)=1$ and not just $|det(d)|=1$). So in matrix notation a rotation is defined by

$$
R=\begin{bmatrix}r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} \\r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} \\r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} \end{bmatrix}, \quad R^TR=RR^T=1,\quad det(R)=1  
$$ {#eq-rot}

Multiplying two rotation matrices $R_1$ and $R_2$ is a again a rotation matrix, this is why rotations in 3D are also called special orthogonal group `SO(3)`. Note that the order of rotations matter and $R_1 R_2 \ne R_2 R_1$

So it's obvious that is over parameterized using 9 values and there are constrains on the $r_{ij}$ so that eq. 1 is fulfilled.

#### Parameterization using elementary rotation.

Many repeated rotation again form a rotations and it can be shown that an arbitrary rotation can be build out of three elementary rotations. First, a counter-clockwise rotation $R_x(\alpha)$ around the $x$-axis by an angle of $\alpha$. Second, $R_y(\beta)$ rotates around "the new" $y$-axis and finally by $R_z(\gamma)$ around the new $z$-axis. So the complete transformation is given by $R(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = R_z(\gamma) R_y(\beta) R_x(\alpha)$. The individual transformations can be derived by looking where the unit vectors are transformed, yielding e.g. for $R_z(\gamma)$ to

$$
R_z(\gamma)=\begin{bmatrix}\cos(\gamma) & \sin(\gamma) & 0 \\-\sin(\gamma) &\cos(\gamma) & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-rx}

In the figure below you see a derivation of the rotation matrix.

![Derivation of the rotation matrix transforming from a fixed coordinate system to a rotated one.](images/rz_gamma.png){fig-align="center"}

The question is "how do the unit vectors look in the rotated system". Note that this transformation matrix transforms from the laboratory system to the "body centric system". Note also that the inverse is the transposed and this corresponds to setting $\gamma$ to $-\gamma$ since $\sin$ is asymmetric. For the initial rotation of the rabbit, we transformed the data and not the coordinate system. Hence, we have to use $R^T$ (or change $\gamma \to -\gamma$) and with $\sin(45^0) = \cos(45^0) \approx 0.7071$ we get same rotation as used in the code used to transform the data.

#### Connections with yaw, pitch, roll

Using the above definition, we can make the following connections (todo check)

-   The yaw angle is $\gamma$
-   The pitch is $-\beta$
-   The roll is $\alpha$

The problem with the approach of elementary rotations is that there is are many possible combinations to chain the elemetary operations. For example some use $R_x(\gamma) R_y(\beta) R_x(\alpha)$ i.e. using $R_x$ twice, some go from body to fixed some the other way. Further, in this parameterization the effect of changing the angles by a bit has different effects depending on the values. In the extreme case changing the angle does nothing anymore, which is known under the name gimbals look (see e.g. [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/better-rotation-representations-for-accurate-pose-estimation-e890a7e1317f) for a nice demonstration).

# Quaternions

Besides defining a rotation by 3 elementary rotations, with the many implied ambiguities and the gimbal lock there are other possibilities to describe rotations. Quaterions are such a possibility used as standard output format of many libraries such as [AHRS](https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#). Rotations can be described by unit[^2] vector $\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)$ and a counter clock wise rotation around this vector by an angle $\theta$.

[^2]: Strictly we could also use a non unit vector but it turns out to be easier for later to consider unit vectors.

![Rotation around a vector](images/rotation_abitrary_vector.png){#fig-rot}

Quaternions are objects which consists of 4 numbers, and the rotation around a vector can be nicely described with them as we will see in a second. But they also have some mathematical raison d'etre.

### Definition of Quaternions

Complex numbers $|a|e^{i \theta}$ describe points in the real / imaginary space and rotations in 2D can be nicely described by them using multiplications. Quaternions can be seen as a generalization of complex numbers with two more imaginary like units $i,j,k$. Using these, the quaternion can be written as:

$$
q =  (q_w, q_1, q_2, q_3) = q_w + q_1 i + q_2 j + q_3 k
$$

The basis have some properties (there are more)

$$
  i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1 \;\; ij = -ji = k 
$$

The length of a quaternion can be determined as:

$$
  ||q|| = \sqrt{q_w^2 + q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 }
$$

Here, we are dealing with quaternions of length 1 and almost all quaternions used in Computergraphics are unit quaternions or a.k.a. rotation quaterions.

### Geometric Representation

For quaternions $q = (w, r_1, r_2, r_3)$ they following connection to the unit rotation vector $\vec{r}=(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ holds:

$$
  q(\theta, v) = \cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) w + i \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) v_1 +
  j \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) v_2 + k \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) v_3 
$$

or componentwise

$$
 q(\theta, v) =  \left(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) w,\; \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})  v_1, \;\sin(\frac{\theta} {2}) v_2, \;\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) v_3 \right)
$$

here $\theta$ is the rotation about the unit vector.

The length of $q$ is $||q||=\cos^2(\theta/2) w + \sin^2(\theta/2) (v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2) = \cos^2(\theta/2) w + \sin^2(\theta/2)$ and hence we need to choose $w=1$ for the unit quaternion.

#### Construction of quaternion from vector and angle

Consider the plane from above. At the start ($t=0$) the laboratory coordinate system corresponds to the one in the plane. This can be described by no rotation $\theta=0$ about any axis $q(0) = (\cos(0), v_1 \sin(0), v_2 \sin(0), v_3 \sin(0) = (1,0,0,0)$. Then before the liftoff it looks in the xy-direction, that is a rotation about 45 degres ($\theta = 45/360 \cdot 2 \cdot pi \approx 0.785$) around $\vec{r} = (0,0,1)$ and $q(1) = (\cos(0.785/2), 0, 0, \sin(0.785/2))$.

### Quaterion Algebra

-   Addition (easy but no geometeric interpretation), just for reference $$
    q + p = p + q =  q_w + p_w + (q_1 + p_1) i + (q_2 + p_2) j + (q_3 + p_3) k
    $$

-   Multiplication: The multiplication is not commutative $$
    q * p \ne p * q = \tt{Complicated Formula}
    $$

-   Conjugate (just i --\> -i same for j and k) $$
    q^* = q_w − i q_x − j q_y − k q_z
    $$

-   Inverse $$
    q^{-1} = q^*/||q||
    $$

So for unit quaternions, you just have to conjugate to get the inverse. Luckily, we don't have to remember the formulaes and can use the onion-package.

### Constructing a rotation matrix from Quaterions (first solution)

It's possible to translate the quaternions back to a rotation matrix, see [quat_to_mat](https://github.com/oduerr/gesture/blob/main/R/rotation_utils.R). The code has been taken from https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-convert-a-quaternion-to-a-rotation-matrix/

```{r}
  t_05 = 0 #half of theta
  q0_d = c(cos(t_05), sin(t_05), sin(t_05), sin(t_05))
  t_05 = 45/360 * pi #half of theta
  q01 = c(cos(t_05), 0*sin(t_05), 0*sin(t_05), 1*sin(t_05))
  #sum(q01^2) #1
  quat_to_mat(q01)
```

### Chaining rotations with quaterions (just multiply them)

Now comes properly the most useful thing, that successive rotations can be done by multiplying the respective quaternions. Let's try this out.

Let's multiply several quaternions. We start with $q_0 = (1,0,0,0)$.

```{r, warning=FALSE, name='bunny1', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
  q0 = onion::quaternion(Re = 1)
  p3d(rabbit %*% quat_to_mat(q0), h=NULL, main = 'q0')
```

We add a second rotation (a first real) around the z-axis.

```{r, warning=FALSE, name='bunny1', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
  q1 = quaternion(Re=cos(-45/360 *pi), i = 0, j = 0, k = 1*sin(-45/360 *pi)) 
  p3d(rabbit %*% quat_to_mat(q0 * q1), h=NULL, main = 'q0 * q1') 
```

We add a third rotation around the x-axis.

```{r, warning=FALSE, name='bunny1', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
  q2 = quaternion(Re=cos(-45/360 *pi), i = 1*sin(-45/360 *pi), j = 0, k = 0) 
  q012 = q0 * q1 * q2 
  p3d(rabbit %*% quat_to_mat(q012), h=NULL, main = 'q0 * q1 * q2')
```

Using the order $q_0 q_1 q_2$ you transfer the data of the bunny.

### Pure Quaternions (real part = 0)

We can also use quaterions to transform vectors, without the need to explicitly construct the rotation matrix as done with the bunny data above. In this case, we set the real part to 0 and use the vector in space as the vector part. That is a vector $\vec{v}$ in a certain direction without coding a rotation. From this vector, we like to know the position to which it gets rotated by $R(q) \vec{v}$ the rotation matrix $R(q)$ corresponding to $q$. It can be shown that this is

$$
  R(q) \vec{v} = q \cdot (0,\vec{v}) \cdot q^{-1} 
$$

```{r}
 q = q0 * q1 * q2 #A unit quaterion defining the direction
 vec = matrix(c(12,13,45), ncol=1) #A vector with which we do the 
 quat_to_mat(q) %*% vec
 
 vec_q = quaternion(Re = 0, i = vec[1], j=vec[2], k=vec[3])
 #q^-1 is the inverse, which for rotation quaternions is the conjugate 
 q * vec_q * q^-1
```

TODO build intuition for this expression, the experssion

#### Using pure quaterions to get the rotation matrix.

We can use pure quaterions to get the rotation matrix, if we can investigate the images of the unit vectors to define the rotation matrix.

```{r}
 round(quat_to_mat(q), 4)
 
 e1b = q * quaternion(Re = 0, i = 1) * q^-1 
 e2b = q * quaternion(Re = 0, j = 1) * q^-1 
 e3b = q * quaternion(Re = 0, k = 1) * q^-1 
 matrix(c(
          e1b@x[2:4],
          e2b@x[2:4],
          e3b@x[2:4])
 ,nrow=3) %>% round(4)
```

### Flight Coordinates from Quaterions (TODO)

```{r}
  qx = quaternion(0,1,0,0)
  qx * q012 * qx^1
  qx = quaternion(0,0,1,0)
  qx * q012 * qx^1
  qx * q012 * qx^1
```

### Rotation between two quaternions.

Consider the two IMUs (like the one on the thumb and the one on the palm), the orientation of the first (w.r.t. the laboratory system) is given by $q_1$ the orientation of the second by $q_2$. What is the rotation getting you from hand to palm. The questions is: which rotation $q_{12}$ translates between them. So we ask which $q_12$ fulfills

$$
  q_2 = q_1 \; q_{12} 
$$

Just calculate the inverse of $q_1$ and you are done

$$
  q_1^{-1} \; q_2 = q_{12}  
$$

## Software package

There are several software packages helping to deal with rotations and quaterions. Like the onion package in R.

### The AHRS Python Package

The AHRS package (https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) used to estimate the rotation of a IMUs (sensors in e.g. cell phones and drones), uses quaternion as lot and also provides some basic operations.

```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
from ahrs import Quaternion
p = Quaternion([0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071, 0.0])
p 
q = Quaternion([0, 0.7071, 0.0, 0.7071])
p * q #0., 1., 0., 0.
q * p #0., 0., 0., 1.
q.conj#0., -0.70710678, -0., -0.70710678
d = q*q.conj 
d
```
