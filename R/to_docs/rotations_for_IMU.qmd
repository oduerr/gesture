This document describes how the orientation of the IMU [MPU-9250](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/9-axis/mpu-9250/) can be calculated.

There are basically two ways to calculate the orientation of the IMU.

-   First we can use the result provided in the sensor fusion algorithm on the chip. This is done in a Digital Motion Processor (DMP) on the sensor chip and send as a quaternion.

-   Second, we can use raw data and do the filtering ourself.\

# Using the DMP quaternion

The result of the calculations in the Digital Motion Processor (DMP) done in the IMU are reported as quaternions (basically a short coding of the rotation between the IMU and the fixed laboratory system). Technically they are send to the Aduino (as a byte vector the `fifoBuffer`). On the Aduino the following steps the result of the FIFO Buffer is parsed and written in a Quaternion with components $q=(q_w, q_x, q_y, q_z)$ this is done in \`dmpGetQuaternion\`

## Getting the quaternion q

In the first line the quaternion send from the DSP is read from the `fifoBuffer` and parsed into the variable `q`. The quaternion `q` contains all information about a single IMU. This is done with the following code:

```{c, eval=FALSE}
uint8_t MPU6050::dmpGetQuaternion(int16_t *data, const uint8_t* packet) {
    // TODO: accommodate different arrangements of sent data (ONLY default supported now)
    if (packet == 0) packet = dmpPacketBuffer;
    data[0] = ((packet[0] << 8) | packet[1]);
    data[1] = ((packet[4] << 8) | packet[5]);
    data[2] = ((packet[8] << 8) | packet[9]);
    data[3] = ((packet[12] << 8) | packet[13]);
    return 0;
}

uint8_t MPU6050::dmpGetQuaternion(Quaternion *q, const uint8_t* packet) {
    // TODO: accommodate different arrangements of sent data (ONLY default supported now)
    int16_t qI[4];
    uint8_t status = dmpGetQuaternion(qI, packet);
    if (status == 0) {
        q -> w = (float)qI[0] / 16384.0f;
        q -> x = (float)qI[1] / 16384.0f;
        q -> y = (float)qI[2] / 16384.0f;
        q -> z = (float)qI[3] / 16384.0f;
        return 0;
    }
    return status; // int16 return value, indicates error if this line is reached
}
```

## Understanding the quaternion

A good source is shown in the following [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv683WQHsWY).

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wv683WQHsWY >}}

The quaternion send from the DMP is a rotation quaternion. A rotation quarternion describes a rotation of $\theta$ around a vector $\vec{r}$ as

$$
q(\theta, v) =  \left(\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}),\; \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})  r_1, \;\sin(\frac{\theta} {2}) r_2, \;\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) r_3 \right)
$$

-   Step 1: Align the lab coordinate system and the coordinate system of the IMU. In this case we have the identity quaternion $q=(1,0,0,0)$

    -   Put the sensor on the table and then rotate until you find the identity quaternion.

-   Step 2: Turn around x-axis in positive direction. If you found the right axis you have $q(\theta, v) = \left(\cos(\theta/2),\; \sin(\theta /2), \;0, \;0\right)$ and a rotation around 90 degrees in positive direction you have \$q=(0,1,0,0)\$ Rotate in the other direction you should get $q=(0,-1,0,0)$

    Repeat step 2 for the remaining axis. If all goes as expected you have a right handed coordinate system with a body-to-lab (a.k.a. frame) based quaternion.

### Calculation of yaw, pitch, roll from quarternion

The code used on the Arduino has been wrong [ypr_calculations.html](https://oduerr.github.io/gesture/ypr_calculations.html) see also [Bugreport](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/issues/222) but it can be directly calculated from the quaternion via.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{roll} &= \text{atan2}(2 \cdot (w \cdot x + y \cdot z), 1 - 2 \cdot (x^2 + y^2)) \\
\text{pitch} &= \text{asin}(2 \cdot (w \cdot y - z \cdot x)) \\
\text{yaw} &= \text{atan2}(2 \cdot (w \cdot z + x \cdot y), 1 - 2 \cdot (y^2 + z^2))
\end{align*}
$$

It is implemented in [quaternion_utils.py](https://github.com/oduerr/gesture/blob/main/python/https://github.com/oduerr/gesture/blob/main/python/quaternion_utils.py) where you also find testing code.
